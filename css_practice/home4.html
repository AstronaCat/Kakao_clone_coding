<!-- "span" & "link" tags are NOT block. However, "div" is included in block.
It means that span and link can be placed at the same line(="inline" available) 
while div cannot.(="inline" inavailable)
Almost every box is defined as block, like header and div.
So it is easy to remember what is not definced as block, for example, span, a, and image.
